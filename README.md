# PairOfEmployeesWorkingTogether
### Application setup on local machine
    Step 1. Clone the repo and navigate to the PairOfEmployeesWorkingTogether folder. Open the PairOfEmployeesWorkingTogether.sln file 
      and run the project.
    Step 2. Open with VS Code my other repository with the frontend project located 
      in the "PairOfEmployeesWorkingTogether.Ng/pair-of-employees" folder and run the "ng serve -o" command in the terminal. 
      This will serve the front end project and will be opened on port 4200.
